"""Answering from the phone, through ekatva (github.com/Theyashsawarkar/ekatva).

When ekatva runs, its socket is /run/user/<uid>/ekatva-root.sock. The
window hands it the request (what it shows, nothing more); ekatva shows it
on your paired phone, and your answer there (which commands, and your
password) comes back here, where it goes through exactly the same steps as
typing it in the window: the sudo check, then the runner.

Only answers flow in; nothing secret flows out. The path comes from the
uid, never from the environment, which the agent asking controls. Pure
Python, no GTK, so CI tests it.
